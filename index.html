        <h2>Samples of My Work</h2>

          <a href="http://brandonemiller.github.io/DriveTime/">
            <div class="drive_time_image">

          </a>
          <h3>DriveTime</h3>
          <p>This application was my final project while at The Iron Yard Academy.  DriveTime takes in times for events and an individuals starting location and ending location.  The application then feeds these locations to Google Maps to create schedules that factor in the driving time to get to an event.</p>

            </div>
          </a>
          <h3>Responsive Design Practice</h3>
          <p>This was a project while I was at The Iron Yard Academy.  This site was created as practice in making a responsive site from a designer's mock up.  It untilizes CSS for all of its responsiveness and achieves it without the need for extra javascript.</p>

        <div class="sample">
          <a href="http://brandonemiller.github.io/ToDoList/index.html">

            </div>
          </a>
          <h3>What To Do?</h3>
          <p>This application was the first project while I was at the Iron Yard Academy that ventured into data persistance.  The app read in task names and descriptions and saved them to a free Parse server account.  The tasks could be deleted or edited and any changes would be persited to Parse.</p>
